excerpt: 'In the literature of object detection in optical remote
sensing images, a popular pipeline is first modifying an off-the-
shelf deep neural network, then initializing the modified network
by pretrained weights on a source data set, and finally fine-tuning
the network on a target data set. The procedure works well in
practice but might not make full use of underlying knowledge
implied by pretrained weights. In this article, we propose a
novel method, referred to as Fisher regularization, for efficient
knowledge transferring. Based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, the method
stores underlying knowledge into a Fisher information matrix
and fine-tunes parameters based on the knowledge. The proposed
method would not introduce extra parameters and less sensitive
to hyperparameters than classical weight decay. Experiments on
NWPUVHR-10 and DOTA data sets show that the proposed
method is effective and works well with different object detectors.'
