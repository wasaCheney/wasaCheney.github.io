&quot;PercepPan: Towards Unsupervised Pan-sharpening Based on Perceptual Loss.&quot;
<i>Submitted to Remote Sensing</i>, 2nd-round review, 2020, 0(0):1-22.'
excerpt: "High resolution multispectral images usually are unavailable for pan-sharpening and
the traditional perspective dealing with the issue is to degrade the original images into a lower
resolution space for supervised training under the Wald's protocol.
In this paper, we propose to train pan-sharpening models in an unsupervised manner directly in the
original resolution space, and construct an unsupervised framework,
referred to as ``perceptual pan-sharpening'', which is based on an auto-encoder and perceptual loss.
Moreover, the framework is mainly trained by a novel training paradigm,
``first supervised pre-training and then unsupervised fine-tuning'', for performance boosting.
The unsupervised framework does not need the degradation step anymore, and experiments show that
the framework with different generator architectures could get comparable results with the traditional
supervised counterpart. Moreover, when generalizing to a new dataset, the unsupervised framework
still performs better (or not worse at least) than its supervised counterpart."
