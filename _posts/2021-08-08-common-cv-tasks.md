<!-- Description for link -->
Common tasks in computer vision:
  - recognition
  - classification, image class labels
  - localization, per-object bounding box labels
  - detection, per-object class+bounding box labels
  - tracking
  - semantic segmentation, per-pixel class labels (all pixels, but do not distinct objects with the same class label)
  - instance segmentation, per-object mask and class labels (only objects)
  - panoptic segmentation, per-pixel class+instance labels (objects and background things)
