Cache is a smaller and fast memory component in the computer which is inserted between the CPU and the main memory.

Buffer is a temporary storage area, usually a block in memory,
in which items are placed while waiting to be transferred from an input device or to an output device.
It is mostly used for input/output processes.

See [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-buffer-and-cache/) for more details.
