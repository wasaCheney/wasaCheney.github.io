This is about tmux --- Terminal Multiplexer for newbies such as me.

Concepts
======
- `tmux` to start a new tmux session (of course, could start many sessions),
  `tmux new -s session_name` start a new session, and from shell terminal env to tmux session env;
  back to shell env? `C-b` then `d(etach)`, will back to shell terminal env, but do not kill the tmux session env;
  attach a tmux session env? `tmux attach -s `
- Session could be detached or attached (useful for re-connecting when ssh is done)

- Shell env could start multiple tmux sessions
- A session could start multiple windows which could be compared to virtual desktops
- A window (usually assigned with a number) could contain multiple panes
- A Pane is the part which you directly work with

Commands on Sessions
========
- Begin with a shell env
- `tmux new -s(ession) session_name`, start and come into a tmux session env named 'session_name'
- `C-b + d(etach)`, back to shell env, while holding tmux sessions background
- `tmux ls` (in sell env), `C-b + s` (in tmux session env), list running sessions
- `tmux a(ttach) -t(arget) session_name`, come into session env from shell env
- `tmux kill-session -t session_name`, `tmux rename -t old_name new_name`, `C-b $new_name`

Commands on Windows
===========
- `C-b c(reate)`, create a window env (in a session env)
- `C-b w(windows)`, list all windows in the current session
- `C-b n(ext)/p(revious)/0/l`, switch windows
- `C-b &`, close current window

Commands on Pane
============
