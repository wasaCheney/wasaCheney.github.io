This is about tmux --- Terminal Multiplexer for newbies such as me.

Concepts:
======
- `tmux` to start a new tmux session (of course, could start many sessions)
- Session could be detached or attached (useful for re-connecting when ssh is done)
- A session could start multiple windows which could be compared to virtual desktops
- A window (usually assigned with a number) could contain multiple panes
- A Pane is the part which you directly work with

<!-- You can have many headings -->
