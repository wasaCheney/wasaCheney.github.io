<!-- Description for link -->
Today, I found some awesome shortcuts to insert
special characters in LibreOffice (LO).

Unicode number method for special characters inputting
======
All in all, the method is that first typing the unicode
number for a special character, and then pressing `alt + X`
together. The number would be transformed into the corresponding
character by LO automatically. Awesome!

I also found another command `ctrl + shift + U + xxx`, where
`xxx` is the unicod number, but it does not work for me.

Look for the unicode-character table? Try the
[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters)!
