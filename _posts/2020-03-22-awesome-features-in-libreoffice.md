<!-- Description for link -->
Today, I found some awesome shortcuts to insert
special characters in LibreOffice (LO).

Unicode number method for special characters inputting
======
All in all, the method is that
1. first typing the unicode number for a special character
1. and then pressing `alt + X` together
The number would be transformed into the corresponding
character by LO automatically. Awesome!

I also found another command `ctrl + shift + U + xxxx`, where
`xxxx` is the unicode number, but it does not work for me.

Look for the unicode-character table? Try the
[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters)!

P.S., if in the VIM environment, try `ctrl + V` and then `U`, final `xxxx`,
such as ≡ ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇ █ ▉ ▐ ░ ▒ ┑┕ ┠


3D effects in libreoffice draw
======
1. Import an image or draw a 2D shape;
2. then right click, find the `convert` -> `To 3D` command
3. then right click again, find `3D effects` to invoke the 3D effect panel.
Adjust properties as you like (especially the depth)
4. Of course, you could also adjust the color and transparency as usual
