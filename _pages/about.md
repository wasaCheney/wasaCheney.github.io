I am Changsheng (pronouned like /ʧɑ:n'ʃən/), currently working in Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. Contact me by email `chsh_zh [at] gdut [dot] edu [dot] cn` or `zhoucslyx [at] gmail [dot] com`

Brief Bio
=========
Changsheng Zhou received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in statistics from Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), Xi'an, China, in 2014 and 2020, respectively.
He worked in Guangzhou University (GZHU), Guangzhou, as a three-year postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics and Information Science.
Since 2024.5, he has been working at the School of Mathematics and Statistics in Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT), Guangzhou, China.

Research Interests
==================
f: X &rarr; y<sup>2</sup>

The current research focuses on generative models, Bayesian learning, and deep learning,
with applications to generic and remote sensing images, such as objct detection, edge detection, etc.

Shortly, I aims to develop accurate, fast, robust/stable, low-cost (labour/material),
explainable, and general-purpose models and algorithms.
