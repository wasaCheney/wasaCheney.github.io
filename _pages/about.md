Research Interests
==================
My current research focuses on Deep Generative Models and Bayesian Learning,
with applications to object detection, image generation and other enjoyable computer vision tasks.

Recently, I am trying to understand the weakly supervised object
detection problem through the generative perspective.

Fight for accurate, fast, robust/stable, low-cost (labour/material),
interpretable, and general-purpose models.

Fight for Xy<sup>2</sup>!
