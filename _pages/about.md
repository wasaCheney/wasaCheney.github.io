I am Changsheng (pronouned like /ʧɑ:n'ʃən/), currently a postodc researcher in Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.

Brief Bio
=========
Changsheng Zhou received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in statistics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2014 and 2020, respectively. Currently, he is a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematics and Information Science in Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.

Research Interests
==================
f: X &rarr; y<sup>2</sup>

The current research focuses on generative models, Bayesian learning, and deep learning,
with applications to generic and remote sensing images.

Shortly, I aims to develop accurate, fast, robust/stable, low-cost (labour/material),
explainable, and general-purpose models and algorithms.

Recently, I am trying to understand weakly supervised object
detection problem through the generative perspective.
